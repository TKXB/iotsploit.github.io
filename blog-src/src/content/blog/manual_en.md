## Overview

File Obfuscation is a feature in iotsploit client that combines steganography and encryption to hide files within images. It provides a secure way to conceal sensitive documents, messages, or any digital content within seemingly innocent image files, effectively bypassing regulatory monitoring and content filtering systems.

**Location**: In iotsploit client, the File Obfuscation tool is available in the **Toolkit** section under the "File Obfuscation" card.

### What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data or a physical object. In our case, we hide files within images in a way that is invisible to the human eye and difficult to detect without the proper tools.

### What is File Obfuscation?
File obfuscation involves making files unreadable or unrecognizable to unauthorized users while maintaining their original functionality for authorized users.

### Regulatory Bypass Benefits
By embedding files within images, this tool provides an effective method to bypass regulatory monitoring systems:
- **Content Filtering Evasion**: Image files are typically not subject to the same content scanning as document files
- **Network Monitoring Avoidance**: Image transfers often pass through monitoring systems without triggering alerts
- **Platform Restrictions Bypass**: Many platforms allow image sharing while restricting document uploads
- **Stealth Communication**: Enables secure file transmission that appears as normal image sharing

## How It Works

The File Obfuscator uses a multi-layered approach to securely hide files:

### 1. Encryption Layer
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption algorithm
- **Salt Generation**: Random 16-byte salt for each operation
- **IV (Initialization Vector)**: Random 16-byte IV for each encryption
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-like key derivation using HMAC-SHA256

### 2. Compression Layer
- **ZIP Archive**: Compresses encrypted data for efficient storage
- **Metadata Storage**: Stores file information and encryption parameters
- **File Organization**: Structured archive with encrypted file and metadata

### 3. Steganography Layer
- **Image Carrier**: Uses your selected image as the carrier
- **Data Appending**: Appends the encrypted archive to the image data
- **Seamless Integration**: The image remains visually identical

## Tool Features

### File Hiding Function

The File Obfuscator tool provides a comprehensive file hiding capability:

**What it does:**
- Encrypts your selected file using AES-256 encryption
- Generates unique security parameters for each operation
- Compresses the encrypted data for efficient storage
- Embeds the data seamlessly within your chosen image
- Preserves the original image quality and appearance

**Input Requirements:**
- File to hide (any type and size)
- Carrier image (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
- Strong password for encryption
- Output location for the result

**Output:**
- An image file that looks identical to the original
- Contains your hidden file securely encrypted
- Ready for storage, sharing, or transmission

### File Extraction Function

The tool also provides secure file extraction:

**What it does:**
- Detects hidden data within obfuscated images
- Validates the image integrity
- Decrypts the hidden file using your password
- Restores the original file with its original name
- Maintains file integrity and metadata

**Input Requirements:**
- Image file containing hidden data
- Correct password used during encryption
- Destination folder for extracted file

**Output:**
- Original file restored exactly as it was
- Preserved filename and file structure
- Ready for normal use

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirement**: The image file must be exactly the same as when it was created. Any compression, resizing, or modification will prevent successful extraction.

## Security Features

### Encryption Details
 

- **Algorithm**: AES-256 in CBC mode
- **Key Size**: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- **Salt**: 16 random bytes per operation
- **IV**: 16 random bytes per encryption
- **Key Derivation**: HMAC-SHA256 with salt

### Security Benefits
- **Confidentiality**: Files are encrypted and unreadable without the password
- **Integrity**: Tampering with the image will corrupt the hidden data
- **Authentication**: Only users with the correct password can access files
- **Non-repudiation**: Each operation uses unique cryptographic parameters

### Threat Protection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Failed to create ZIP archive"
**Cause**: Memory issues or corrupted input data
**Solution**: 
- Ensure sufficient memory is available
- Verify input file integrity
- Check file size limits

#### 2. "No hidden file found in the image"
**Cause**: Image doesn't contain hidden data or is corrupted
**Solution**:
- Verify the image contains hidden data
- Check if the image was modified after hiding
- Ensure the correct image file is being used

#### 3. "Metadata file not found in the hidden data"
**Cause**: Corrupted or incomplete hidden data
**Solution**:
- Verify the image wasn't truncated
- Check for file corruption
- Ensure the complete image is loaded

#### 4. "Error extracting file"
**Cause**: Incorrect password or corrupted data
**Solution**:
- Verify the password is correct
- Check for typos in the password
- Ensure the image wasn't modified

#### 5. "File extraction failed after chat transmission"
**Cause**: Image compression or modification by chat applications
**Solution**:
- Always use the original obfuscated image file
- Avoid sharing through chat apps that compress images
- Use direct file transfer methods (email, cloud storage, USB)
- Verify image file size hasn't changed after transmission

### Performance Tips
- Use appropriate image sizes for your hidden files
- Consider file compression before hiding
- Use strong, memorable passwords
- Keep backups of original files
